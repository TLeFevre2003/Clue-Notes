# Overview

In this project, I was trying to accomplish making a web app in react to further my web development skills and see if that is something
I am interested in doing for a career.

The web app that I wrote is a clue notes app. You can add players and mark what cards everyone has. Starting the test server is easy, if you have nodejs installed, navigate to the correct path
in this case it is my-react-app, and in the terminal type npm run dev.

I wrote this because I find in the board game Clue, it is somewhat wasteful using paper
for notes so I wrote an app to reduce waste.

# Web Pages

My web app has only one page, but on that page it is able to dynamically create players and buttons in a grid.

# Development Environment


The tools for this software was vs code, and I also downloaded node.js.

The programming language was javascript with the react web framework.

# Useful Websites

* [React Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqcY0GlETPk)
* [React Documentation](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

# Future Work

* I would like to add something that allows you to type down notes in addition to the buttons.
* I want to let you enter in each player's move so the app can solve on its own the 3 cards.
* I would like to see if I can optimize the app for different screen sizes.
